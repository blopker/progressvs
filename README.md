Python VS Progress Benchmarks
=============================

##Summary
Comparing the calculation speeds of Python and Progress.

##Usage
Just run the test file for each language.

##Tests
###Newton's
Newton's method of finding minimums is used to calculate the square root.

This test is being run 100000 times to find the square root of 89262175 to an accuracy of .0001.

Newton's test will show the raw calculation power of each language.

###Fibonacci
The Fibonacci test calculates the nth Fibonacci number recursively.

This test is being run 100 times to find the 20th Fibonacci number.

Fibonacci's test will demonstrate how well each language deals with large stack depths.

##Resutls
Results are in seconds and shows the total time for all iterations of each test.

###Python
Total time for Newton's method: 1.8387305817
Total time for Fibonacci's number: 1.04261769261

###Progress
Total time for Newton's method: 22.132
Total time for Fibonacci's number: 21.064
